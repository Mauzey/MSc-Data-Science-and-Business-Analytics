# MATH513
Sophisticated analytics techniques are needed to visualize today's increasing quantities of Big Data. Up-to-date R tools including dplyr for data manipulation, ggplot2 for visualization, and knitr/LaTeX for document presentation are studied. These are applied to database interrogation, social network visualization, and sentiment analysis. The module provides considerable experience of writing professionally documented R code using RStudio.
